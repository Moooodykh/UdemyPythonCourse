""" 
# The collections module is a built-in module that implements specialized container data types 
# providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers. 
# We've already gone over the basics: dict, list, set, and tuple.
# Now we'll learn about the alternatives that the collections module provides.

### ------ Counter -------

# counter will count how many time the item shows up and then return the item as key and how many times as value
print(Counter(lst))

#counter with string
name = 'aaasdcsdssxsddvsds'
print(Counter(name))

#Counter with words in a sentence
s = 'How many times does each word show up in this sentence word times each each word'

print(Counter(s.split()))

c = Counter(s.split())

print(c.most_common(3))
# give you the most common three elements

c.update({'sara':1})
# this is just adding a new element(key,value) to the existing dictionary 

c.update({'each':3})
# added each by thre extra more times 


print(c)

d = Counter(s.split())

# total of all counts
print(sum(d.values()))

# reset all counts
# d.clear()
# print(sum(d.values()))

# list unique elements
print(list(d))
# convert to a set
print(set(d))
# convert to a regular dictionary
print(dict(d))

# convert from a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
print(d.items())

# c.most_common()[:-n-1:-1]       # n least common elements
print(d.most_common(2))
print(d.most_common()[::-1])

# remove zero and negative counts
d += Counter()
print(d)
###### Common patterns when using the Counter() object ######

# sum(c.values())                 # total of all counts

# Escape Codes
##########

# You can use special escape codes to find specific types of patterns in your data, 
# such as digits, non-digits, whitespace, and more. For example:

# Code	Meaning
# \d	a digit
# \D	a non-digit
# \s	whitespace (tab, space, newline, etc.)
# \S	non-whitespace
# \w	alphanumeric
# \W	non-alphanumeric
# \A	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string	"\AThe"
# \b	Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word
        # (the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	
        # r"\bain"
        # r"ain\b"	
# \B	Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word
        # (the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	
        # r"\Bain"
        # r"ain\B"
# \Z	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string	"Spain\Z"

# Escapes are indicated by prefixing the character with a backslash \. 
# Unfortunately, a backslash must itself be escaped in normal Python strings, 
# and that results in expressions that are difficult to read. Using raw strings,
#  created by prefixing the literal value with r, eliminates this problem and maintains readability.

# Personally, I think this use of r to escape a backslash is probably one of the things 
# that block someone who is not familiar with regex in Python from being able to read regex code at first.
#  Hopefully after seeing these examples this syntax will become clear.
