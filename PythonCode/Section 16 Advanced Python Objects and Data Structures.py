""" 
#####    Hexadecimal
# Using the function hex() you can convert numbers into a hexadecimal format:
print(hex(12))
print(hex(200))

#####    Binary
# Using the function hex() you can convert numbers into a hexadecimal format:
print(bin(128))
print(bin(127))

#####    Exponentials
# The function pow() takes two arguments, equivalent to x^y. 
print(pow(2,4))
print(pow(4,4))

# With three arguments it is equivalent to (x^y)%z, 
print(pow(2,4,3))

#####    Absolute Value
# The function abs() returns the absolute value of a number. 
# The argument may be an integer or a floating point number. If the argument is a complex number, its magnitude is returned.
print(abs(-3.15))
print(abs(-3))

#####    Round
# The function round() will round a number to a given precision in decimal digits (default 0 digits). It does not convert integers to floats.
print(round(3,2))
print(round(1395,-3))
print(round(395,-2))
print(round(3.14233321,2))

# Python has a built-in math library that is also useful to play around with in case you are ever in need of some mathematical operations.
#  Explore the documentation here!
